# Mission-to-Mars

In the Mission to Mars challenge we are creating a website using scrapped data from different web data sources. We used a flask interface to create the website. We used python to create a script that scrapes the data. We use a chrome driver to navigate all the websites and extract appropriate data. We used HTML to present all the information.
